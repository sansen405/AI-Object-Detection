This repository contains an Artifical Intelligence project I developed during the summer, leveraging YoloV3 and Tensorflow for real-time object detection. Given a video input, the program generates bounding boxes around objects, offering predictions of object identification and confidence percentages. We have tested this object detection model to work with roughly 95% accuaracy in its predictions.
