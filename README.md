This repository contains an AI project I created over the summer that utilizes YoloV3 and Tensorflow to make highly accurate predictions of object in real-time. Upon inputing a video (street view from vehicle), the program will create bounding boxes around objects, providinf a prediction of what the object is and the percent confidence.
